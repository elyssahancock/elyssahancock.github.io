      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this site is to provide a reference of my work.
         I want to showcase what I know how to do and provide examples of it. 
         I would like to include my work of websites, graphic design, and photography all in this website.
         Different pages for different skillsets would be ideal that way it was not distracting.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p> The audience of the website will be anyone that would benefit from 
        seeing my work. This could include future employers, collegeas or 
        teammates, or anyone else that is interested in what I have created.  </p>  <!-- change this -->
