<h2>Elyssa Hancock</h2>
<p>
 I am majoring in software engineering (BS) and this is my first semester.
 I love singing and playing the piano.
  I love how different the atmosphere is here at BYU-I compared to other places I have been. 
I think learning about web design is a good skill for anyone because there are so many small businesses in need of a good website. 
I have been a member of the church my whole life and my favorite scripture is Hebrews 11.
